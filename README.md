# Map Factory 4


Map Factory 4 eliminates geometron and strips down the system to just map and scroll.



## Rules of Organic Media:

- everything replicates
- everything is editable
- everthing can get deleted
- next instance needs only the previous instance, no central code base referenced at all, same for subsequent instance

## To Do:

### Immediate, top priority:

- replicator.php, use to put on a remote server from github code, then replicate from new server to new one after that(make it living organic thing)
- deletebranch added so a branchdown can be undone
- design layout of hypercube.html(on paper)
- make it easy to export urls from feed to import into index.html 
- make index.html have nav as default
- fix layout, convert to css, to make it dynamic and work with mobile, same for all pages(web design) 

### Top Level/System

- branch down further tested
- add deletebranch
- replicator.php working, used to replicate to servers
- build a better CSS framework for the overall shape of the screens, make it dynamic so resize doesn't break everything
- add and test mobile functionality for all pages(portrait instead of landscape)
- try building out a universe of things: cherry tree shopping center for instance
- write the physical Book of Geometron, build a Universe of Things around it
- build a Universe of Things around ArtBox
- build a Universe of things with markers/maps/signs in physical locations as prototype
- build protocol for replicating a whole Universe
- plot out the path to build rapdily replicating post capitalist technology with this: build a factory in a location in space defined by a street and watershed, work in a locally defined Trash Camp, build/make/create, create economic activity in capitalist system which generates money locally but globally creates self replicating things which can expand across the system.  *Locally* people in Capitalism are drawn into our system by the profit motive, but globally our system totally undermines capitalism by releasing things for free which repilcate without money.
- add codemap.html, a MAP object which has links to editor.php?filename=[this file] for each file in the system, showing how they all go together
- add propagator.html which is a scroll that tells the user how to propagate the System using:
    - hostinger with paid hosting and a new domain, which can generate email addresses which are used to get..
    - 000webhost free hosting
    - raspberry pi zero w based local server on a local wifi
    - MAMP localhost 
    - php localhost


### index.html

- put nav on top instead of array display
- map import from remote
- JSON string import/export
- make text elements actually scale properly in some rational way with fontSize
- fix hammer on vertical sliders on work computer
- add link to editor, make editor dynamically update for whatever files are around, either html or in js or php, css
