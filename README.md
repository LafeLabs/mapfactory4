# Geometron 5

Geometron 5 is a rewrite of geometron 4, streamlining and drastically enough changing things that I wanted a clean slate.


Geometron 4 further unified the elements:


- symbol
- scroll
- map
- propagator

This system is self replicating. Test.

## Here is the symbol for "scroll" in Geometron:
 
![](http://lafelabs.org/mapicons/scroll.svg) 


## Rules of Organic Media:

- everything replicates
- everything is editable
- everthing can get deleted
- next instance needs only the previous instance, no central code base referenced at all, same for subsequent instance

## To Do:

### Immediate, top priority:

- replicator.php, use to put on a remote server from github code, then replicate from new server to new one after that(make it living organic thing)
- deletebranch added so a branchdown can be undone
- design layout of hypercube.html(on paper)
- make it easy to export urls from feed to import into index.html 
- make index.html have nav as default
- fix layout, convert to css, to make it dynamic and work with mobile, same for all pages(web design) 

### Top Level/System

- branch down further tested
- add deletebranch
- replicator.php working, used to replicate to servers
- build a better CSS framework for the overall shape of the screens, make it dynamic so resize doesn't break everything
- add and test mobile functionality for all pages(portrait instead of landscape)
- try building out a universe of things: cherry tree shopping center for instance
- write the physical Book of Geometron, build a Universe of Things around it
- build a Universe of Things around ArtBox
- build a Universe of things with markers/maps/signs in physical locations as prototype
- build protocol for replicating a whole Universe
- plot out the path to build rapdily replicating post capitalist technology with this: build a factory in a location in space defined by a street and watershed, work in a locally defined Trash Camp, build/make/create, create economic activity in capitalist system which generates money locally but globally creates self replicating things which can expand across the system.  *Locally* people in Capitalism are drawn into our system by the profit motive, but globally our system totally undermines capitalism by releasing things for free which repilcate without money.
- add codemap.html, a MAP object which has links to editor.php?filename=[this file] for each file in the system, showing how they all go together
- add propagator.html which is a scroll that tells the user how to propagate the System using:
    - hostinger with paid hosting and a new domain, which can generate email addresses which are used to get..
    - 000webhost free hosting
    - raspberry pi zero w based local server on a local wifi
    - MAMP localhost 
    - php localhost


### index.html

- put nav on top instead of array display
- map import from remote
- JSON string import/export
- make text elements actually scale properly in some rational way with fontSize
- fix hammer on vertical sliders on work computer
- add link to editor, make editor dynamically update for whatever files are around, either html or in js or php, css


### scroll.html

- add no-update mode
- add math mode
- add conversion to standalone doc with hammer.js
- add icons for modes instead of words
- add copy remote scroll option

### feed.html

- add links
- add text
- add external feed import functionality, test input/output
- add system for copy/paste of markdown code from here to drop into scroll in readme

### symbol.html

- dynamic x0 and y0, unit, put these into the glyph feed as an object
- add svg functionality, export, save, etc
- background image functionality(low priority)

### hypercube.html

- export images with glyph spelling 
- export images with much more customization than symbol.html(ok to have it be complicated here, for expert users)
- design overall window layout and functionality
- easy import and export of fonts, shape tables, etc, sharing of all the parts
- metalanguage for robotics functionality set up as simple template
- control panel editor
- keyboard editor
- style editor
- product properties: shape, format, x0,y0, unit
- standard library of shapes and fonts:
    - katakana dots font
    - english dots font
    - hebrew calligraphy font
    - nautical signal flag font
    - standard circuit diagrams
    - quantum gates
    - golden ratio sacred geometry
    - yoga stuff
    - watershed symbolism, language of Watershed
    - street symbolism, language of Street
    - factory symbolism, language of Factory

is this a better way to edit?
