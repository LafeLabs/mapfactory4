# Map Factory 4

The Map Factory is a system for building web pages that are "maps" in a general sense: a two dimensional arrangement of images, words, and links.  It is "organic media", or media which behaves like a living thing, and in concert with living things(us, the users).

## Rules of Organic Media:

- everything replicates
- everything is editable
- everything can get deleted(to save a thing, save a local backup or put it on a permanent text file archive like pastebin or github)
- next instance needs only the previous instance, no central code base referenced at all, same for subsequent instance
- there are no passwords or logins, all pages are totally open
- sites tend to be anchored in real physical places, like a shopping center, public library, neighborhood, park, church, stream/river/creek, intersection, highway rest stop, community center, etc.  
- this is based on an idea of a "universe of things", where things are considered in the most general sense possible: places, ideas, objects, actions, subjects, etc.  
- By building a language for building up online representations of "things" in the broad philosophical sense which can self replicate there is the potential to build a vastly larger universe of online information than exists in the current Internet, in a totally decentralized way
- this is not a company, not a non profit, not a centralized thing.  When it is copied, the next instance is not at a lower or higher level in any hierarchy than the previous one.  
- for those interested in the technical side, this is as front end as possible, just javascript, html, and a very small amount of php for the sole purpose of accessing the local file system.  No SQL servers or other databases are used ever.  Nothing should ever be installed via a command line or other professional tools: installation is simply by copying a single replicator.php script and running it, which can be run from a browser without any server side access at all  if you want a free tour of the code and a lesson in how to improve on it and use it for your own purposes email lafelabs@gmail.com
